The Extra Feature:

 3. F2 key to make picture not visible
 3. Cick on image and press ESC key to delete it in shortcut
 4. Press Space to focus on contents box, and enter to input the contnent and focus on panels.
 

 Important design decisions:

 1. In normal spreadsheet, people would love to use some shortcut key to control your spreadsheet, 
 so we decide to design some shortcut key like enter and space to let you swith bewteen the spreadsheet
 and contentsbox, and some more keys is in the feature.

 2.We have hard time stucking with computiong 2 non-digit character. After we made some changes in PS5, which
 helps us a lot to print out expected outcome we need.
